## DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, IT IS A TEMPLATE.
# Rat Rig V-core Pro Klipper Config

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment
# the files and/or settings you need.
# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:
# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

# Uncomment this next line if you have an ADXL345 connected to your control board
#[include config/sensors/adxl345.cfg]

### HOMING

## Probe - You Must Uncomment 1 of the following options
# BL Touch
#[include config/z-probe/bltouch.cfg]
#[bltouch]
#z_offset: 0.0 # Adjust this to fit your setup

# Inductive/Capacitive probe
#[include config/z-probe/probe.cfg]
#[probe]
#z_offset: 0.0 # Adjust this to fit your setup
#pin: ^probe_pin # For NPN NC probes such as the Super Pinda / Vinda / SupCR / Decoprobe probes.
#pin: ^!probe_pin # NPN NO (refer to the specs on your probe)
#pin: probe_pin # PNP NO (refer to the specs on your probe)
#pin: !probe_pin # PNP NC (refer to the specs on your probe)

## Endstops - You Must Uncomment Physical endstops and Endstop position or Sensorless Homing
# Physical endstops
#[include config/printers/v-core-pro/physical-endstops.cfg]
#[safe_z_home]
#home_xy_position: 150,150 # 300mm printer
#home_xy_position: 200,200 # 400mm printer
#home_xy_position: 250,250 # 500mm printer

# Endstop position
# Adjust this to your setup
# Note: might need fine tuning.
#[stepper_y]
#position_endstop: 300  # 300mm printer
#position_endstop: 400 # 400mm printer
#position_endstop: 500 # 500mm printer
#[stepper_x]
#position_endstop: 0

# Sensorless homing (Beware: this requires manual tinkering and does not work if your x/y stepper drivers
# have clipped DIAG pins). It is strongly encouraged to use physical endstops if you're a beginner.
# If you still wish to proceed, copy config/templates/sensorless-homing.cfg to the root directory and
# remove the # from the line below.
#[include sensorless-homing-tmc2209.cfg]

### PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS
# Remove the # from your printer size below.
# Similarly add a # in front of [include config/printers/v-core-pro/300.cfg] if you have a bigger machine.
[include config/printers/v-core-pro/300.cfg]
#[include config/printers/v-core-pro/400.cfg]

### MACROS
[include config/macros.cfg]

### MACRO CONFIGURATION
[gcode_macro RatOS]
# Use relative extrusion mode
# Set to False to use absolute extrusion mode
variable_relative_extrusion: True
# Wait for extruder to reach 150 so an inductive probe (if present) is at a predictable temp. 
# Also allows the bed heat to spread a little, and softens any plastic that might be stuck to the nozzle.
# Set to False to disable
variable_preheat_extruder: True
# Calibrate the bed mesh in the START_PRINT macro.
# Set to false to skip BED_MESH_CALIBRATE, it will still load the BED_MESH 
# with the name "ratos", be sure to save your bed_mesh profile with that name.
# or override the _START_PRINT_BED_MESH macro to implement your own mesh handling logic.
variable_calibrate_bed_mesh: True
# Print a prime line at the end of the START_PRINT macro
# set to False to disable nozzle_priming.
variable_nozzle_priming: "primeline"
# Park in the back when waiting for the extruder to heat up
# set to "front" to park in the front, or "center" to park in the center.
variable_start_print_park_in: "back"
# Height to park it when waiting for extruder to heat.
variable_start_print_park_z_height: 50
# Park in the back after the print has ended or was cancelled.
# set to "front" to park in the front, or "center" to park in the center.
variable_end_print_park_in: "back"
# Park in the back when the print is paused.
# set to "front" to park in the front, or "center" to park in the center.
variable_pause_print_park_in: "back"
# Set the speed for travel moves in RatOS Macros in mm/s.
