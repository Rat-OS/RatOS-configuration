## DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, IT IS A TEMPLATE.
# Rat Rig V-core Pro Klipper Config

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment 
# the files and/or settings you need.
# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:
# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

### BASE SETUP
[include config/printers/v-core-pro/v-core-pro.cfg]
[include config/printers/v-core-pro/steppers.cfg]
[include config/printers/v-core-pro/tmc2209.cfg]

### Stepper mechanical overrides
[stepper_x]
dir_pin: x_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse X stepper direction
rotation_distance: 40 # 40 for 20 tooth 2GT pulleys, 32 for 16 tooth 2GT pulleys

[stepper_y]
dir_pin: y_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse Y stepper direction
rotation_distance: 40 # 40 for 20 tooth 2GT pulleys, 32 for 16 tooth 2GT pulleys

[stepper_z]
dir_pin: !z0_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse Z stepper direction
rotation_distance: 8 # 4 for TR8*4 lead screws

[stepper_z1]
dir_pin: !z1_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse Z1 direction
rotation_distance: 8 # 4 for TR8*4 lead screws

[stepper_z2]
dir_pin: !z2_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse Z2 direction
rotation_distance: 8 # 4 for TR8*4 lead screws

[extruder]
dir_pin: !e_dir_pin # Remove ! in front of pin name to reverse extruder direction

# Uncomment this next line if you have an ADXL345 connected to the SKR PRO
#[include config/sensors/adxl345.cfg] 

### HOMING

## Probe - You Must Uncomment 1 of the following options
# BL Touch
#[include config/z-probe/bltouch.cfg]
#[bltouch]
#z_offset: 0.0 # Adjust this to fit your setup

# Inductive/Capacitive probe
#[include config/z-probe/probe.cfg]
#[probe]
#z_offset: 0.0 # Adjust this to fit your setup
#pin: ^probe_pin # For NPN NC probes such as the Super Pinda / Vinda / SupCR / Decoprobe probes.
#pin: ^!probe_pin # NPN NO (refer to the specs on your probe)
#pin: probe_pin # PNP NO (refer to the specs on your probe)
#pin: !probe_pin # PNP NC (refer to the specs on your probe)

## Endstops - You Must Uncomment Physical endstops and Endstop position or Sensorless Homing
# Physical endstops
#[include config/printers/v-core-pro/physical-endstops.cfg]
#[safe_z_home]
#home_xy_position: 150,150 # 300mm printer
#home_xy_position: 200,200 # 400mm printer
#home_xy_position: 250,250 # 500mm printer

# Endstop position
# Adjust this to your setup
# Note: might need fine tuning.
#[stepper_y]
#position_endstop: 300  # 300mm printer
#position_endstop: 400 # 400mm printer
#position_endstop: 500 # 500mm printer
#[stepper_x]
#position_endstop: 0

# Sensorless homing (Beware: this requires manual tinkering and does not work if your x/y stepper drivers
# have clipped DIAG pins). It is strongly encouraged to use physical endstops if you're a beginner.
# If you still wish to proceed, copy config/templates/sensorless-homing.cfg to the root directory and 
# remove the # from the line below.
#[include sensorless-homing.cfg]

### PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS
# Remove the # from your printer size below. 
# Similarly add a # in front of [include config/printers/v-core-pro/300.cfg] if you have a bigger machine.
[include config/printers/v-core-pro/300.cfg]
#[include config/printers/v-core-pro/400.cfg]
